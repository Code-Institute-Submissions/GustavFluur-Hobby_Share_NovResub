# Design Plan:

The design of the Hobby Share changed along the the way but importantly is the outcome and the functions behind the webpage. 

### Homepage:

The homepage was designed like this because I wanted to create a perfect introdution for the user to feel a sense of welcome once they are visiting the page:

#### Bugs Report

### 1.

## In the file: create_post.html

###   Error
    form class="create-post" id="create_post_form" method="post" action="{% url 'create_post' %}"

The data wasn't registrated from the form and the images wasn't uploaded to the home page. However, in the database demonstrated from tableplus it was registrated there and as well as in the django administration page. 

### Fixed Error
    form class="create-post" id="create_post_form" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" action="{% url 'create_post' %}"

The issue was resolved by adding the enctype attribute and everything was finally added into the data, which the user was now able to post images related to their blogpost. It was required to have this feature cause without it would create a bad user experience and the purpose of the website wouldn't meet up to its expectations.

#### views.py

#### Errors
##### CRUD: 
class CreatePost(View):

    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return render(
            request,
            "create_post.html", 
            {
                "form": PostForm()
            },
        )
        

    def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):

        post_form = PostForm(request.POST)

Related to the issue above in terms of uploading and creating posts, it was unable to pin a image into the your own blog. Thanks to no request.FILES where added in the function. That generated the problems to store data for user's benefit and see were it went. 


## Fixed Error

class CreatePost(View):

    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return render(
            request,
            "create_post.html", 
            {
                "form": PostForm()
            },
        )
        

    def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):

        post_form = PostForm(request.POST, request.FILES)

By added request.FILES in the post form it was finally resolved by adding this missing feature. Once something is missing it creates error and thanks to the documentation from the terminal it gave the path of a good result to determine where the bug was. 

# 3


In the register page of the Hobby Share, it created an error due some issues regards to the settings.py file and that led to some errors along the way of project's process:

- The a new potential user is trying to set up a new account:

![Typing in the email](static/readme-images/error-try-signup-with-email.png)
- Error message:

![Error Message](static/readme-images/error-message-after-signup.png)

## settings.py

### First Issue: 
ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION = False

### First change & failed: 
ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION = True

### Result: 

![ConnectionRefusedError:](static/readme-images/error_message.no-signup-with-email.png)

### Final and solution: 
ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION = 'none'

##### Another error of the CRUD

While working with CRUD function it was some issues to add the delete one, since I was doing the same changes and added the same functions with different attributes, names etc it gave me an error. It send the information on my website: http 405 which meant that no right method has been used and the website crashed. It also was a late night and it led on layers of more issues and a sense of feeling that you were stuck in a loop of bad repetion. 

#### Error:


class PostDelete(View):

    def get(self, request, id, *args, **kwargs):
        post = get_object_or_404(post.id)
        post.delete()

        return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('home'))
    
##### Fixed Error

    class PostDelete(View):

        def get(self, request, id, *args, **kwargs):
            post = get_object_or_404(Post, id=id)
            post.delete()

            return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('home'))
