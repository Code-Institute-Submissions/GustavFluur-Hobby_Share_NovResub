                      <p>Hobbies can sometimes be difficult to find what is right for you and using <strong>Hobby Share</strong> as a
                        community will make you as a user introduced to trying something new. Today people are often getting overwhelmed by
                        all sorts of information either from social media, news, or things on daily basis. We want to make it easier for
                        people to see what is out there and get inspired to start with a new hobby. </p>

                      <p><strong>Hobby Share</strong> was established in the late 1990s in Manhattan, New York as a brick-and-mortar store.
                        Where book clubs were renting the place and organized events to share their most trending books with potential
                        customers. A couple of years later the user behavior changed profoundly since the internet became a powerful source of
                        communication and the market choose organizations like Amazon to get all the introductions of the best-selling books
                        online as well as able to make a purchase. It made us rethink our business strategy and we wanted to create something
                        new for our market. That is how we came up with the idea that if people can share their hobbies online it will create
                        a sense of gathering point. </p>

                      <p>Thus, not only books but interest of any kind is a great place to get to know each other. Today people are receiving
                        all sorts of information from social media and other websites that can be very overwhelming for some people, but a
                        platform like Hobby Share is able to create a channel for sharing ideas. Most importantly create an online community.
